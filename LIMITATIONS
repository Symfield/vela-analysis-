## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

### Current Data Source
This notebook currently uses **synthetic data** generated from published 
radial profiles (Sushch+2011). The shell positions and asymmetry patterns 
are based on literature values.

### What This Means
- The outputs demonstrate framework consistency
- They do NOT constitute independent discovery
- Real FITS analysis is needed for validation

### Why Synthetic?
Chandra archive access requires specialized credentials. We're working 
on proper data acquisition. Meanwhile, this shows the computational 
pipeline works.
